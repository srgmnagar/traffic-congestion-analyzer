ðŸš¦ Traffic Congestion Prediction using Real-Time Data (TomTom API)
ðŸ“Œ Project Overview
This project aims to analyze and predict traffic congestion using real-time data collected from the TomTom Traffic API.
The dataset consists of traffic flow readings (current speed, free-flow speed, confidence, etc.) collected every 15 minutes across multiple locations in Mumbai & Navi Mumbai.

We combine data engineering, exploratory analysis, feature engineering, and machine learning to:

Understand traffic patterns (rush hours, weekends, location-wise trends)

Detect congestion patterns using derived metrics

Build a predictive model to forecast traffic conditions

âœ… Current Features Implemented
ðŸ“¡ Automated Data Collection from TomTom API

ðŸ—„ SQLite Database Storage (traffic_data.db)

ðŸ”„ Data Enrichment with derived fields:

is_weekend â€“ weekend flag

is_rush_hour â€“ rush-hour flag

congestion_level â€“ free-flow vs current speed difference

traffic_ratio â€“ normalized speed measure

speed_drop_percent â€“ percentage slowdown

ðŸ§¹ Data Cleaning & Wrangling (handling outliers, sorting, consistency checks)

ðŸ”¥ Planned Steps
Data Cleaning & EDA

Analyze congestion patterns

Compare rush vs non-rush, weekend vs weekday

Identify outliers and data reliability

Feature Engineering

Add lag features, rolling averages

Encode time-of-day segments (hour_bin), location clusters

Predictive Modeling

Regression (for speed prediction)

Classification (for congestion category)

Real-Time Prediction Pipeline

Integrate model to predict upcoming congestion using live API data

Visualization & Deployment

Interactive dashboard (Streamlit / Power BI)

Historical vs predicted traffic trends
